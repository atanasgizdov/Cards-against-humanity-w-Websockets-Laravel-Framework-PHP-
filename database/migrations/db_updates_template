$ php artisan make:migration add_page_count_field_to_books_table
In the resulting migration, your up method would look something like this:

public function up() {
    Schema::table('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->integer('page_count');
    });
}
And your down method would look something like this:

public function down() {
    Schema::table('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->dropColumn('page_count');
    });
}
When you next run php artisan migrate, it would recognize this new migration that has not been run, and it would run it, altering your books table.
